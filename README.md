# SonicLevel-PobbleBonk
The SonicLevel-PobbleBonk App sounds like a congregation of frogs in a pond. You navigate around the pond by tilting the spirit level. Different frog-calls come from each quadrant and become more distinctly different as you approach the centre. This allows you to tell which way to go as you get close to level. When you reach the level spot in the middle the frogs stop calling and the pond goes quiet.

# Sonic Tilt

Sonic Tilt is the open-source branch of Tiltification, the sound leveling app on both iOS and Android. For more information, check out our [website](https://tiltification.uni-bremen.de/).
