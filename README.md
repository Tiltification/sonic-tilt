# SonicLevel-Crickets
The SonicLevel-Crickets App is modelled on a singing cricket that stops singing when you move toward it. This sonification provides information about relative movement rather than absolute position in the 2D space. It is a minimal approach where sound and silence provide binary information.

# Sonic Tilt

Sonic Tilt is the open-source branch of Tiltification, the sound leveling app on both iOS and Android. For more information, check out our [website](https://tiltification.uni-bremen.de/).
The App is written in [flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and ships to both Android and iOS.
